# Introduction

Hello! My name is Tyler Barbero. During the summer of 2019, I started my first
research internship. I've been working with Dr. Amato Evan and PhD candidate
Alexandra Kuwano.

### What are we doing?

Overall, our lab wants to understand the meteorological
processes behind dust storms in the Salton Basin.

### My unique role

I am using a GPS/receiver called the Trimble NetR9 to estimate the precipitable
water vapor (PWV) in the atmosphere. This will help us understand the
composition of air masses causing dust storms and will therefore help us
prove or reject our hypothesis on how dust storms form in this region. I have
been working on code to automate downloading raw GPS data from the GPS 
to the our server on Sahara.
The summer has ended and I am now continuing research as I start my 4th year
as an undergraduate as SIO, UC San Diego.
