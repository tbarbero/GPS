Welcome to this repository. This is for the research I've been working on
this summer! Overall, our lab wants to understand the meteorological
processes behind dust storms in the Salton Basin. My unique role includes
using a GPS/receiver called the Trimble NetR9 to estimate the precipitable
water vapor (PWV) in the atmosphere. This will help us understand the
composition of air masses causing dust storms and will therefore help us
prove or reject our hypothesis on how dust storms form in this region.
