### Evan Research Lab
The Evan Research Lab aims to study how the shrinking Salton Sea will affect
dust storm activity in the surrounding region. In order to do this, we have
constructed a research site that provides us with continuous measurements of
aerosols, boundary layer structure, water vapor and radiative fluxes. With
this information, we hope to better understand the mechanics of dust storm
formation in this region.

### My Role
My role encompasses using the Trimble NetR9 GNSS Receiver to estimate the
precipitable water vapor (PWV) in the region. The GPS communicates with GPS,
Galileo, and GLONASS satellites and records observables, one of them being
the pseudorange. The pseudorange is the absolute path the signal travels
through the atmosphere. We can isolate the path delay caused by water vapor
and estimate the PWV through a retrieval. By having a visual of the water 
content in the atmosphere, we can better understand the physis of
air masses causing dust storms from downslope windstorms.
